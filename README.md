##PacMan Assignment
<p>Just when you thought PacMan was a rudimentary game from the '80s, begin to understand the difficulty of making this simple circle-dude move. Mandibles are complex, even in 2-D game characters. </p>

##Description
<p>Assigned by MIT's xPRO coding course, use the intital images of PacMan (mouth open and closed) and make the image move back and forth. Use your imagination for the snack pellets he would eat, because we're not quite there yet.</p>

##Installation 
<p>Nested functions and code blocks inside the function Run() make up a lot of this code. </p>

##Usage
<p>Used to figure out how much I still need to learn (Feb 2021).</p>

##Support 
<p>https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+code+pacman+back+and+forth+javascript (helpful)</p>

##Roadmap
<p>Understanding this better and improving the animation is my ongoing goal.</p>
